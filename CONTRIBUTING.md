## Generating data using the Web API Confluence Dashboard
If the feature you're interested in is a JavaScript API, you can cross-reference data against [Web API Confluence](https://web-confluence.appspot.com/) using the `confluence` command. This command overwrites data in your current working tree according to data from the dashboard. See [Using Confluence](USING-CONFLUENCE.md) for instructions.
