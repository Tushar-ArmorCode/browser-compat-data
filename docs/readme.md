# Contributing to browser-compat-data

We're really happy to accept contributions to the mdn-browser-compat-data repository!

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:

* **Add new compat data**: familiarize yourself with the [schema](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data.schema.json) and read the [schema docs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data-schema.md) to add new files.
* **Fix existing compat data**: maybe a browser now supports a certain feature. Yay! If you open a PR to fix a browser's data, it would be most helpful if you include a link to a bug report or similar so that we can double-check the good news.
* **Fix a bug:** we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues),
or maybe you found your own.
* **Review a pull request:** there is a list of [PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls).
Let us know if these look good to you.
